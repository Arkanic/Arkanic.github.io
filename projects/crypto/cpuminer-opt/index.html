        <h1>Cpuminer-opt install script</h1>
        <p>This works for Raspberry PI models, although i've only ever tested it on a model 4B.</p>
        <p>[object Object] on the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/gnRYQQtp86">Magi Lounge Discord Server</a> made the original command sequence, and i compressed it into two installation scripts.</p>
        <p>This setup is multi-step, as there is a reboot required for it to work.</p>
        
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <h3>1. Run script 1</h3>
        <p>The first script will install raspbian-nspawn-64.</p>
        <p>run the following command in the terminal/over ssh:</p>
        <p><code>sudo curl -s https://Arkanic.github.io/projects/crypto/cpuminer-opt/script/install-s1 | bash</code></p>
        <h3>2. Reboot RPI</h3>
        <p>A reboot is required once the setup of raspbian-nspawn-64 has completed.</p>
        <h3>3. Run script 2</h3>
        <p>This script will enter the x64 bit shell, install the required libs, clone the cpuminer-opt source code, and then build the miner.</p>
        <p>run the following command in the terminal/over ssh:</p>
        <p><code>sudo curl -s https://Arkanic.github.io/projects/crypto/cpuminer-opt/script/install-s2 | bash</code></p>
        <h3>4. Done</h3>
        <p>every time you want to use the miner, enter the x64 shell by using the ds64-shell command if you arent already in it, cd to the cpuminer-opt directory, and use the script with the ./cpuminer command (use the --help flag for more information)</p>
